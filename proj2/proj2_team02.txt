1. Difference between concurrent and parallel?
	Cocurrency refers to a specific order of execution, while parallel implies execution of tasks simultaneously.


2. 
	Note that Dexter's syscall takes 100us + 1ns to get the generated data pointfrom kernel to user land.
	a.) No points are lost. The data is generated at 1 point per millisecond which gives Dexter's syscall enough
	    time to complete before new data arrives.

	b.) Data is now generated at 1us. Approximately 99% of data is lost due to overhead delay. Assuming it takes 50us to
	    get from user space to kernel space, the first 50 points are lost. the 51st point will be copied due to the 1ns
    	    copy time. After, another 50 points will be lost. This ycle repeats.

	c.)

	d.)
