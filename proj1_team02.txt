Q2
Access to data structures in userland needs to be syncronized only if multiple threads are attempting to access a single resource. 

Q3
There are several synchronization mechanisms that can be used, semaphore and mutexes are a type of lock that is commonly used to access shared resources. 

Q4
Spin locks can technically be used on a single processor platform. But using spin locks is not advisable because when the processor is spinning it won't be able to service the task that has the lock which means the task that is spinning will not be able to move acquire the lock and stop spinning. This situation is a type of deadlock.
